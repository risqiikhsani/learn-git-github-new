Great question — the difference between **merge**, **squash**, and **rebase** in Git (especially for GitHub pull requests) affects your project’s commit history and collaboration style.

Here's a breakdown of each:

---

## 🔀 1. **Merge**
**Creates a merge commit** that combines the feature branch into the base branch (e.g., `main`).

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

### ✅ Pros:
- Preserves full history of all commits
- Shows exactly how the feature developed

### ❌ Cons:
- History can get messy with lots of small commits
- Adds noise to `git log` (especially if multiple devs are merging frequently)

### 📦 Result:
```
*   Merge branch 'feature-branch'
|\
| * commit C
| * commit B
|/
* commit A (main)
```

---

## 📚 2. **Squash**
**Combines all commits** in the PR into a **single commit** on `main`.

```bash
git merge --squash feature-branch
```

GitHub also lets you click “Squash and merge” on PRs.

### ✅ Pros:
- Clean, concise commit history
- Ideal for teams that don’t want WIP (work-in-progress) commits cluttering history
- Easier to roll back a full feature

### ❌ Cons:
- Loses individual commit granularity (if that matters to you)
- Makes debugging with `git bisect` slightly harder

### 📦 Result:
```
* commit SQUASHED-COMMIT
* commit A (main)
```

---

## 🧬 3. **Rebase**
**Rewrites commit history** so it looks like your branch was built directly off the latest `main`.

```bash
git rebase main
```

Useful **before** merging to make the history linear.

### ✅ Pros:
- Clean, linear history
- No extra merge commits
- Good for small/independent feature branches

### ❌ Cons:
- Rewriting history can be dangerous on shared branches
- Can confuse beginners if conflicts arise

### 📦 Result:
```
* commit C (rebased)
* commit B (rebased)
* commit A (main)
```

## ✅ Which one should you use?

| Workflow Style           | Recommended Strategy     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Clean history            | ✅ **Squash and merge**   |
| Trace all development    | ✅ **Merge**              |
| Linear history, advanced | ✅ **Rebase + squash**    |

### ⚙️ Common Team Practice:
- Use **squash** for PRs (keep main clean)
- Use **merge** for large or shared feature branches
- Use **rebase** locally before PR to keep branches clean
